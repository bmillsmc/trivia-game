# Trivia
This is a browser based trivia game. Its fully functional using Javascript, CSS, and HTML. It uses an API called [OpenTrivia](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to populate its questions and answers.

## Live Location
The game is deployed [here](https://bmillsmc.github.io/trivia-game/lib/) and is easy and free to play. It works on both desktop and mobile, so feel free to send it to your friends no matter their device.

## Playing the game
To play simply open the website and you will be brought to a page where you can pick your catagory, difficulty, and how many questions you want to play. The game is scored based on time. You have 15 seconds to answer each question and if you get it correct your remaining time is added to your score. If you get it wrong or run out of time, you'll lose points. At the end you'll get your score and how many questions you got right and wrong.

# Usage
This site can be used to challenge your friends, test your knowledge, or learn something new. See who can get the highest score on each catagory!

## Suggestions
I'm always looking to learn and grow as a developer. I'm not afraid of critisism, so please don't be afraid to give me suggestions for the site to make it better. Also please always point out bugs so that I can fix them.
